# Linianos

program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for

multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Linio". For multiples of 5 print

"IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Linianos".

 

But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary

operators or `else`.
